* How to use the different files

*************************************************************************************
* Performing a statistical comparison
*************************************************************************************

1. Open the conf.json file and edit the variable dataset_path
   to indicate the path where the images are stored. Such a
   folder must have a subfolder for each class.
2. In the conf.json file modify the variable model to select
   the model that you want to execute.
3. Extract the features of the dataset using the following
   command:
   python index_features.py -c conf/conf.json
4. Perform the statistical analysis comparing different methods.
   New methods can be added in the StatisticalComparison.py file.
   Currently the methods that are available are RandomForest, SVM, KNN, LR, MLP and
   Gradient Boost.
   To perform the analysis use the command:
   python StatisticalComparison.py -c conf/conf.json
   This will take some time but at the end you will get a report
   comparing the different methods.


*************************************************************************************
* Training a classification model
*************************************************************************************

Once that you have determined the best model with the statistical
comparison, you can create a classification model for further use.

1. Open the conf.json file and edit the variable modelClassifier
   indicating the model that you want to use.
2. Train the model executing the command:
   python train.py -c conf/conf.json

*************************************************************************************
* Using the trained model to predict the class of a new image
*************************************************************************************

After training a model, you can use it to predict the class of
new images.

1. Execute the command:
   python prediction.py -c conf/conf.json -i imagePath
   In the above command you must replace imagePath with the path of the image.
